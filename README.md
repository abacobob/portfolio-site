# portfolio-site

This site is intended as a portfolio displaying recent projects that I have completed for clients or for independent development.

## Core technologies

This site is built primarily with HTML and CSS, using the bootstrap 4 library for responsive design. The site is delivered from Heroku hosting using a simple Express server. Little interactivity is required, so limited JS has been used in this build.

## NPM dependencies

-Express: used for the server-side delivery of static web content
-Nodemon: Used for streamlining server development; not required in the final build.

## Run this project

Use the command 'Node App.js' to run this project in a local environment.
